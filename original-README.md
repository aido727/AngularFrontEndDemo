# Frontend Developer Coding Challenge
-----------------------

Your challenge is to build an application to list the top 10 questions on Stack Overflow.

### Requirements:
* Build a responsive web interface that uses [our design](https://www.figma.com/file/fsFs4MJp0AK8kiPj2RKpW60f/FED-Project-Layout-TEST?node-id=1%3A2) as a guide and to export any design assets you may need, 
* Use this [Stack Overflow API](https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?pagesize=10&order=desc&sort=votes&site=stackoverflow) endpoint to source the question data.
* The exercise can be completed using whichever technologies you're most comfortable with
* Send your solution through within 48 hours, but please don't spend any more than **4 hours** on it, even if you don't think it's finished or ready. We're more interested in your process than seeing a _final_ product.
* Include a README.md that has
    * Instructions on how to run your app
    * Explanation of the project structure
    * What areas you focused on getting done
    * Identify expected error cases that are unhandled and the impact they could have on the solution
    * Details on what compromises you are making in the interest of time
    * What you would improve in future iterations or with more time
* Submit a pull request at the end of the time period and let us know via email.

### Your code challenge will be reviewed against the following criteria:
* Styling and interactive aspects (If you want to show off your design skills then hand-code your HTML & CSS/SASS/LESS)
* Functionality (Show off your JavaScript/TypeScript skills)
* Creativity
* Code readability and clarity
* Test quality (If you have time)

Note: The point of this challenge is to demonstrate your own code, please do not copy existing solutions from the web or other sources (you can use an app starter, but please note in your readme what you've used). It's best to focus on the areas of this challenge that highlight your strengths as a developer!
